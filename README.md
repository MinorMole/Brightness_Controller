## Introduction

Brightness Controller is a PC monitor brightness controller (control the actual monitor's brightness!). Based on the C# language.

#### The good reason to create this software is I'm tired of reaching my monitor and go through junk menu just to change my monitor's brightness!

It's work with most of GPU and monitor (even latest 4K monitor) and work well with HDMI, DisplayPort and may work with some DVI, D-Sub port too, but more research needed! It's support from the latest Windows 10 to Windows Vista and may work with Windows XP too (but who care?!)

#### Because I'm not familiar with C# language, any improved version of the code from you is welcome and much appreciate!
