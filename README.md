## Introduction

Brightness Controller is a PC monitor brightness controller (control the actual monitor's brightness!). Based on the C# language.

#### The good reason to create this software is I'm tired of reaching my monitor and go through junk menu just to change my monitor's brightness!

It's work with most of GPU and monitor (even latest 4K monitor) and work well with HDMI, DisplayPort and may work with some DVI, D-Sub port too, but more research needed! It's support from the latest Windows 10 to Windows Vista and may work with Windows XP too (but who care?!)

#### Because I'm not familiar with C# language any improved version of the code is welcome and much appreciate!

* My test setup was...

  - Monitor: LG 27UD68-W 4K display connect with DisplayPort.
  - GPU: ASUS GTX 970
  - OS: Windows 10 version 1809

## Features

* Control the actual monitor's brightness.
* Can control multiple monitor.
* Supports the large number of PC's monitor and GPU.
* Supports with latest Windows 10 and older.
* Can assign hotkey to change brightness from your keyboard.

* If you want it to run it on the startup open Run panel and type "shell:startup" then place the "Brightness Controller.exe" there.
* If you have change any connector of your monitor or just start PC up from sleep mode while the software still running you may need to right-click at the Brightness Controller notify icon and click "Reload Monitor"
